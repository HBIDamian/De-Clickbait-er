## Before you start summarizing:
Once you installed the extension, you'll need a [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) API Key. 
Then, go on a chosen website, and click Summarise. 

## Don't have an OpenAI Key nor do you plan to?
Well... follow these steps. 
1. Uninstall the extension.
2. Head on over to [My Website Version](https://trinculo.xyz/projects/declickbait/). It's not as good or reliable as the extension, but it uses the same prompt. Due to it essentially downloading the whole page and its contents, some websites block it. So it works half the time. The extension is more reliable though.
3. (Optional) If you do use my web version, help fund for my OpenAI usage every once in a while by clicking the button below.

   Just enough to buy me a coffee at my local coffee shop!

## Why did I make this?
News services like to abuse clickbait in any article they publish. 

Let's show an example. 

> "John Doe in hospital for shocking lifechanging diagnosis"

##### In reality: 
> "John Doe bruised his toe by stubbing his toe on a table."

Clickbait misrepresent articles, erode trust, and spread misinformation. This MUST end!

      <li>On social media posts of these clickbait articles, comment the summary given by the extension!

Until governments accept this, the world will forever be tainted by clickbait articles!
