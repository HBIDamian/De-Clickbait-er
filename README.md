# De-Clickbait-er
A Chrome and Firefox extension that uses OpenAI to summarize/De-Clickbait-ify articles and websites. 

## How to use:

- [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/de-clickbait-er/) 
- [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/de-clickbait-assistant/aamaobkojcphkahpaifolohmhbepcmie)

Once you installed the extension, you'll need a [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) API Key. 
Then, go on a chosen website, and click Summarise. 

It's pretty "Plug and Play". 

## Why did I make this?
News services like to abuse clickbait in any article they publish. 
Let's show an example. 
> "John Doe in hospital for shocking lifechanging diagnosis"

In reality: 

> "John Doe fractured his toe"

This is why I made [this petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/703126) on the UK Parliament website. If you're from the UK, please help the cause!
Until that is considered, this is why I made this tool.
